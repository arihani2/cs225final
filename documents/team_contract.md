# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
We will conduct weekly Zoom meetings on Thursdays (whenever we are available) to discuss project updates and delegating new tasks for the upcoming week. Our team meetings will most likely last around 15 mins - 1 hr, but can last as short or as long as we need it to last. Anthony Rihani will be designated note-taker, and will record any future tasks we need to accomplish. We will help each other in problems we each encountered and give constructive feedback on code. 

2. **Assistance** 
We will communicate using Snapchat. We expect teamates to respond to messages within a few hours and show up to meetings on time. Personal messages and calls over Snapchat are used if necessary and are expected to be responded to as soon as available.

3. **Respect** 
In order to ensure everybody speaks, we will ask each other about the progress we have made and if we have any questions. Darren Biskup is the designated facilitator to ensure everybody speaks. We will show respect to each other. We will respect each other's ideas and only write code everyone is in favor of writing.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will distribute the work approximately 25% per person. Each person will work on the part of the project that they are the most passionate about. If a complication occurrs, we will discuss during our weekly meetings how to distrubute the work so that we all have equal tasks to do. Team members are encouraged to ask for help for any work they are not sure how to do, and all other team members should take a thorough look.


5. **Time Commitment** 
Team members will be expected to spend around 1-2 hours per week contributing to the project. This time does not include the weekly Zoom meeting to sync with the team and discuss project updates. Overall, there is not an exact time that should be expected because there could be more or less work to be done depending on the week. In terms of prior time commitments, as long as our group communicates with each other and makes considerable progress, we should not have an issue with this topic. If new committments or time conflicts occur, we will be flexible and understanding with each other. We will adapt as necessary, even if it means changing our meeting times.

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
When conflicts arise, we will talk together as a team and peacefully resolve the issue through communication. We will encourage team members to be honest with each other when solving conflicts. In the end, we can take a democratic votes between the two people disagreeing and one designated tie-breaker, if necessary. If one or more team members have not accomplished their tasks, we can simply have a discussion with them to ensure they are on the right track to finishing their tasks, because we understand that there may be many reasons for something to be unfinished. We should not have situations where one or more person is habitually late, since we regularly communicate and understand each other's prior committments, but if something like this occurs, we will figure out why it is happening and figure out a solution, such as changing the meeting time. Overall we do not need to discuss any potential situations ahead of time, but rather deal with them as they occur.
