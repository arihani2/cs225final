# Development Log (Date: 10/28/22 -- 11/04/22)

## Weekly Goals
The main goal of this week was to create the team contract, propose a final project idea, and create a Github repository for the team to use for the final project.

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Everybody contributed to creating the team contract, proposing a final project idea with a underlying question that the project will answer, and creating a Github repository for the team. 
## Problems Encountered 
We faced difficulty understanding the project scope and had to email our designated mentor to ask some clarifying questions about the requirements of the project.

## Plans for next week
The main plan for next week is to identify exactly what datasets we want to process and develop a plan to process the data and what data structure to use to store the data.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
How many of the algorithms/traversals are we expected to implement?

## Weekly Goals
The main goal for this week was to review the feedback from the course staff and revise the team contract and team proposal. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All team members contributed to revising the contract and proposal documents. Eduardo and Matthew collaborated on the team contract, Darren and Anthony collaborated on the Project proposal.

## Problems Encountered 
We encountered difficulty choosing the optimal data structure to store our graph and adjacency list on. After discussion, we decided on using a std::set to store each graph node's adjacency list.

## Plans for next week
The plan for next week is to begin implementing the data processing and data storage of the airport dataset. Afterwards, we plan to lay out the codea architecture for implementing our first algorithm: BFS.

## Optional: Questions for mentor
N/A

## Weekly Goals
Determine and plan out data parsing procedure and laying out the basic graph class and setting up the adjacency list data structure to store nodes and edges of the graph. The edges would have weight that's based on the distance. 

## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
All members of the team contributed to setting up the edge class and the graph class and pushing the two classes to the GitHub.

## Problems Encountered 
We encountered problems and confusion on how to set up a MakeFile for us to be able to make and run test cases.

## Plans for next week
Figure out how to make a working MakeFile. Also, start parsing and processing all the data from the airport database. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
Potentially we might need help creating a Makefile.
